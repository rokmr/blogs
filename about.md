# About This Blog

Hi, I'm **Rohit Kumar** — an AI Engineer specializing in Computer Vision, LLMs, Agentic AI, and Diffusion Models.

This blog is where I share deep technical dives into AI/ML topics that I find interesting. Expect:

- **Mathematical breakdowns** of neural network architectures
- **Implementation tutorials** with PyTorch code
- **Research paper walkthroughs** and critical analysis
- **Production ML insights** from building real systems

## Background

I'm an IISc Bangalore M.Tech graduate (GATE AIR 221) currently working on:
- Diffusion pipelines for photorealistic product imagery at **Avataar AI**
- Agentic AI pipelines at **Armada AI**

Previously, I've worked on computer vision research, incremental learning, and built end-to-end ML systems.
